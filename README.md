# Ceasings
A simple and ready to use C easings library.


This library was written using as reference the AHEasings library (https://github.com/warrenm/AHEasing)
and using the easings code from http://gizma.com/easing/ and http://robertpenner.com/easing/ with the 
intention to use and be used for anyone who needs it. 

The only real diference with the AHEasing library is that Ceasings uses the
t, b, c, d inputs while AHEasings uses only the p input, making it diferent
to use from the C# http://robertpenner.com/easing/ script. So this is the 
reason I decided to create it.
