# Ceasings
A simple and ready to use C easings library,  a port of Robert Penner's easing equations to C (http://robertpenner.com/easing/)


This library was written using as reference the AHEasings library (https://github.com/warrenm/AHEasing) and
all the code was taken from http://robertpenner.com/easing/

The only real diference with the AHEasing library is that Ceasings uses the
t, b, c, d inputs while AHEasings uses only the p input, making it diferent
to use from the C# http://robertpenner.com/easing/ script. So this what I created it for.
